**This package is a work in progress**

This package allows for the creation of custom Minecraft clients using for 1.21.1.
It is developed alongside my other package [minecraft-net](https://crates.io/crates/minecraft-net).

## Features / Goals

- [X] Allow login to servers in offline mode
- [ ] Allow for encrypted connections (something's still wrong there, help welcome)
- [X] Allow for configuration of the client
- [ ] Handle the "Play" phase

## Known issues:
- Encrypted connections don't work (servers in online mode)
- pinging/getting the status is inefficient

## Note:
This project is not in any way affiliated with Mojang and/or Microsoft.
Use at your own risk.

It is also still in development.
